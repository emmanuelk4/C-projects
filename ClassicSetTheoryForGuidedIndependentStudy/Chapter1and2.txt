Defining Real Numbers using irrational numbers
Imagine a number line, rith irrational r that divides a line into Left(L) and (R). The set of real numbers Q, is the set of all these partitions.
We use Dedekind sets, dividing the rational number line into two.

Dedekind left set- subset r of Q that
(i) r is a proper, nonempty subset of Q;
(ii) r is closed to the left
(iii) r has no maximum element
Dedekind cut - a partition of rational numbers into two sets A and B, such that elements in are les than B and A has no greatest element

A real number is a Dedekind left set and R is the set of all such numbers

Qtn: Is {p E Q : p <= 0.5} a real number? No because it violates property (iii) since its sup(0.5)
2. DEscribe the dedekind left set for -3? [q E Q: q < -3]
3. Dedekind left set for sqrt(2)? {q E Q: q^2 < 2 or q is negtaive} (q is negative closes the set on the left )
