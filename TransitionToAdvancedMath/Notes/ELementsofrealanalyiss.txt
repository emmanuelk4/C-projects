Field - a set that satisfies addition and multiplication properties
Complete ordered field- only set of Rea numbers
 Completeness- non-empty set is bounded above, so it has a supremum
 Meaning? If an alien came up with a number system, it would be real, maybe the symbols would be different
 Alternative meaning - there are no gaps or dedekind cuts like in set of rational numbers

 Archimedean principle - you can exceed the value of any integer by adding another integer to it

 Formal - if p and e are positive, then ne > p for some integer n
